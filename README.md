# HistoricalSoundChange-Lexurgy

Simulating the development of real-world languages via Lexurgy Sound Change Applier.

Goals of this project:
* Generate tree visualizations of the development of Indo-European words
* Verify posited Indo-European sound changes
* Detect possibly unknown words
* Sound-change existing Indo-European words to daughter languages to create neogolisms
* Compare Chinese topolects
* Verify the reconstructions of Old and Middle Chinese
* Construct the expected pronunciations of Latin-Xenic, Sino-Xenic, Sanskrit-Xenic, and Sinitic literary forms in different languages during different borrowing periods
* See what Min, Bai, Caijia, Longjia, Luren, and Waxiang (Sinitic languages that aren't derived from Middle Chinese) can tell us about Old Chinese
